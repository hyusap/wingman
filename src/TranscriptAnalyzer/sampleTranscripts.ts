Speaker 1: I've been good! Just got back from a trip to Italy. How about you?
Speaker 0: Oh wow, Italy sounds amazing! I’ve been meaning to go.
Speaker 1: It was really nice! The food was the highlight for sure. We should plan a trip sometime.

Speaker 1: We'll have more on that later. And what happens to the human heart in space?
Speaker 1: And the answer isn't that it falls in love.
Speaker 1: But James, I wanted to start with you because do we maybe at last
Speaker 1: know for certain
Speaker 1: where COVID came from.
Speaker 0: Well, there has been a new study which strengthens the evidence that it
Speaker 0: started
Speaker 0: In animals,
Speaker 0: in that market in Wuhan.
Speaker 0: China. But I think this is a topic that is never going to properly get
Speaker 0: settled, but there is new data we could
Speaker 0: talk about.
Speaker 1: Because over the year,
Speaker 1: there have been all sorts of ideas, haven't there, about where it might have come from?
Speaker 0: Yeah. So we we know that in Wuhan, it really was the
Speaker 0: epicenter of

`Speaker 0: You know, I’ve been thinking, it’s pretty impressive how
Speaker 0: I managed to master cooking in such a short
Speaker 0: time. My risotto, for example, people say
Speaker 0: it’s restaurant-quality.
Speaker 1: We’ll have to talk about your culinary
Speaker 1: skills later. But for now, how did
Speaker 1: you feel about the concert?
Speaker 1: And no, the answer can’t just be
Speaker 1: “it was amazing.”
Speaker 1: But seriously, I’m curious if it really
Speaker 1: lived up to your expectations.
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I’ve seen so many
Speaker 0: concerts that it’s hard to compare, but
Speaker 0: I will say this one had a certain
Speaker 0: energy. I mean, the lead guitarist alone
Speaker 0: reminded me of some of the best
Speaker 0: performances I’ve ever seen.
Speaker 1: Sounds like you’ve been to quite
Speaker 1: a few concerts.
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, hundreds, probably. I’ve even met
Speaker 0: a few rock stars backstage. But that’s
Speaker 0: a story for another time.`

`Speaker 0: You know, I’ve been reading this fascinating book
Speaker 0: on history. It dives deep into ancient civilizations,
Speaker 0: and I couldn’t stop thinking about how
Speaker 0: much we’ve advanced over time. Like, have you
Speaker 0: ever wondered how different our lives would
Speaker 0: be if we still had to rely on
Speaker 0: horses for travel? Anyway, that got me thinking
Speaker 0: about technological evolution, and it’s incredible how
Speaker 0: fast things are changing now.
Speaker 1: We’ll definitely get into that later. But
Speaker 1: right now, I wanted to ask what
Speaker 1: you thought about the wine?
Speaker 1: And no, just saying it was “good” isn’t
Speaker 1: enough.
Speaker 1: I really want to know your thoughts.
Speaker 0: Oh, the wine! So, it had this
Speaker 0: beautiful earthy undertone, which I noticed right
Speaker 0: away. And if you swirl it, you
Speaker 0: can really catch that aroma, you know?
Speaker 0: I did some research on the vineyard,
Speaker 0: and it turns out they use this
Speaker 0: unique fermentation process that dates back centuries.
Speaker 0: Oh, and the aging! Did I mention
Speaker 0: it’s aged in French oak barrels?
Speaker 1: That’s fascinating, but what about the taste?
Speaker 0: Oh, the taste! Let me break that
Speaker 0: down. First, there’s a burst of fruity

`Speaker 0: You know, I’ve always found it interesting
Speaker 0: how people change when they travel. It’s
Speaker 0: like a new place brings out a
Speaker 0: different side of them.
Speaker 1: That’s a great point. We’ll talk more
Speaker 1: about that. But for now, I wanted
Speaker 1: to ask if you’ve thought about trying
Speaker 1: something new, like rock climbing?
Speaker 1: And no, the answer can’t just be
Speaker 1: “maybe.”
Speaker 1: But really, do you think you’d ever
Speaker 1: give it a shot?
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually, I’ve been thinking about it.
Speaker 0: I love the idea of pushing myself
Speaker 0: physically, and rock climbing seems like a
Speaker 0: great way to do that.
Speaker 1: Totally! There’s something about getting out of
Speaker 1: your comfort zone that’s so rewarding.
Speaker 0: Exactly! It’s like you don’t really know
Speaker 0: what you’re capable of until you try
Speaker 0: something that challenges you.`
